## Work History ##

`2015–2017`
__Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. (NASDAQ: JCTCF)__, North Plains, OR
- Member, Board of Directors
- Invited by founder & CEO to join Board of a diversified multi-national ~$50M public company. Assigned to Audit and Compensation Committees. Advised on e-commerce & marketing strategies. Closely involved in search for new CEO, enabling founder to retire.

`2011–2017`
__Sarnian Solutions__, Portland, OR
- Entrepreneur in Residence/Founder
- Semi-retired following a successful tech career, I spent most of my time and energy looking after my elderly parents, with occasional minor consulting gigs, until my mother’s decease.

`2013`
__EnergyRM__, Portland, OR
- VP Marketing
- Key contributor to strategic planning, design and implementation of initial business plan, marketing plan & marcomm program in seed-stage venture-backed company with ground-breaking efficiency-measurement meter technology (the "DeltaMeter") and paradigm-transforming transaction model ("MEETS"), designed to invert the systemic disincentives to deep investment in energy-efficiency measures which presently impact both commercial building owners and regulated-rate energy utilities. The company's early progress has been delayed by the glacial pace of change, catatonic conservatism of the utility industry, and reflexive predilection for addressing novel business and operational challenges by resorting to regulatory capture.

`Oct 2010–2011`
__CauseOn Inc.__, Portland, OR
- Executive Instigator
- Brought in late into an early-stage startup undergoing an extended investment drought, I was able to rekindle fresh energy and conviction within a demoralised small team. Unfortunately, a key strategic partnership nurtured by the CEO morphed into a deadly brand mill-stone…

`2008–Nov 2010`
__cc:Sync, Inc.__, Portland, OR
- VP Marketing/Co-Founder
- Recruited by a foresighted telecom executive for a play on group messaging, based on industry-insider technical knowledge to leverage an obscure but substantial systemic operational advantage over other extant strategies. Then, along came Twitter…

`2006`
__Collectability, Inc.__, Portland, OR
- CEO/Co-Founder
- Collectability was an pre-seed company focusing on the social networking needs of collectors. I helped the original founder crystallize a business plan, and we began building website infrastructure, preparing for seed-stage investment, and positioning for strategic relationships in the online auction space. We ran full-tilt; but we were late to the party: after 2 venture-backed competitors announced strategic partnerships with the world's biggest online auctions company, eBay, further capital access was no longer a realistic prospect.

`2005`
__Liquid Markets, Inc.__, Portland, OR
- CEO/Co-Founder
- Raised $160K in venture capital in 90 days [on track for $1M total in next 60 days] at idea-stage company, using only a PowerPoint deck to woo & win commitment from a technology billionaire/Google seed investor. I apparently made it look so easy that the Founder/Majority shareholder was inspired to take over from there, since the venture's success was now clearly assured. Googling "Darple" (later branding) suggests otherwise…

`Mar 2004–Nov 2004`
__GoPotterGo!-PAC__, Portland, OR
- Organizer
- Formed independent Political Action Committee, successfully propelling underdog mayoral candidate to victory in both Primary, General election cycles.
Raised funds; implemented guerrilla communications strategy, including full e-commerce; implemented PR campaign; designed creative; placed media buys. Result (Primary): executed $6K media spend in last 2 weeks (official campaign couldn't afford media). In 3 weeks from last published poll to ballot, swung race 11 pts to candidate, snatching 1st place from highly-funded "incumbent" opponent. Result (General): an October poll flagged that complacent post-Primary campaigning had completely eroded candidate's early lead. I immediately raised additional funds, and conceived & executed $8K GOTV/brand-association doorhanger campaign, reaching 35K households on opening weekend of vote-by-mail cycle. My PAC's highly-controversial cross-race endorsement captured a full week's news cycle—snatching easily $40K+ of earned media. We took a 23-point victory.

`Mar 2004–May 2004`
__Frank Dixon for City Council__, Portland, OR
- Campaign Manager
- Hired in last 8 weeks of Primary by 1 of 6 neighborhood "protest candidates" independently challenging an aggressively-funded City Council incumbent. Full campaign responsibility, reporting directly to candidate, for communications strategy: built & deployed display-ad and direct-mail creative & collaterals; placed media; built full e-commerce (Drupal); and executed PR campaign. Result: candidate just missed 1st place, by a tiny margin. We were proud of our principled, honorable campaign; but we'd started fractionally too late for victory.

`Dec 2003–Mar 2004`
__Tom For Mayor Campaign__, Portland, OR
- Marketing/Outreach Director
- Worked directly with campaign manager & candidate in come-from-behind Primary. 
- Conceived & implemented successful merchandising program; conceived & implemented successful web presence, including full e-commerce; conceived & implemented most campaign collaterals. Resigned to form GoPotterGo!-PAC, surmounting fatal self-limits of official campaign organization, to decisively advance candidate's cause via external resources.

`2004`
__Lightfleet Corporation__, Vancouver, WA
- Corporate Communications Manager
- Hired by CEO/Founder of severely-undercapitalised developer of new interconnect technology for massively parallel computation/high-speed data switching/massive IO systems, to re-energize demoralized team, assist with fundraising, PR & marcomm. With zero external budget, I: branded core technology (“Lumiband”); created fresh web site; rewrote all major presentation materials (business plan, PowerPoint, etc.); revised CEO’s outbound shareholder letters; helped re-tune strategy development and tactical materials—enabling successful new relationships with multiple prospective strategic customers/partners, including industry-leading national airline, data warehousing supply, and network storage companies. My work-products directly enabled the Company to successfully raise over $1Million in new investment capital.

`2003`
__Verinform, Inc.__, Portland, OR
- VP Marketing
- Verinform, a boutique consulting services company, was transitioning from enterprise-scale medical software services play. Hired by the co-founder/CEO, and working closely with the CFO/COO, I rapidly developed an aggressive marcomm program and messaging strategy for the key product launch. Within 6 months post-launch, my work-products drove a qualified sales pipeline of over $20M.

`1999–2002`
__BigWake.com, Inc.__, Portland, OR
- CEO/Founder
- Born in the Dot-Com Bubble as a boating portal; recruited strong BoD; raised $300K seed. Wooed and won traffic deal with car giant Autobytel.com; cut content deal with #1 US marine lifestyle publisher; earned loan originator rôle with #3 US marine lender CIT; partnered with #1 West Coast marine insurer. Partner to West Marine [NASD:WMAR], #1 US accessories retailer. Built national Certified Service Center network. Built web site with boat configurator, infrastructure for big-$ transactions, and closed 1st-ever online new boat sale. Post-Crash, reinvented as a sales, marketing & fulfillment service provider, offering a superior consumer boat-buying experience  to manufacturers versus typical dealer networks, slashing retail real-estate overhead. Sold repo'd sport-fishing boats in South LA, returning 92% of capital basis to note-holder in 90 days (400% faster & 225% larger return than distressed-inventory norm.) Proved our model viable, but unable to access adequate initial operating capital.

`1996–2000`
__RuleSpace, Inc.__, Portland, OR
- Co-Founder/CEO/Chairman
- Bootstrapped a pioneering internet-exclusive B2C utility app company into a provider of industrial-strength content-recognition services & world’s leading Parental Controls services provider, depended on by MSN, Yahoo!, AOL, Intel, NetApp, France Telecom, and many others.  Won 3 major US patents for content categorization; recruited strong BoD; built stable, cohesive mgmt team; secured funds from sophisticated investors; and conceived 3 innovative products: WebQuick&trade;, WebChaperone&trade;, RuleSpace Enterprise Edition&trade; (all winning category-leader plaudits from industry reviewers.) Much guerilla PR, plus Senate Commerce Committee testimony on filtering technology.  RuleSpace raised over $25M from primarily Bay Area investors. Key IP acquired by MSFT (2002). Residual operations unit was highly profitable, enabling later MBO. RuleSpace then leveraged its domain expertise to build a mobile-centric content categorization stack, and was acquired by SYMC (2010).

`1992–1995`
__Now Software, Inc.__, Portland, OR
- Macintosh Consumer Products Line Manager
- Hired as entry-level Customer Support Specialist, promoted to full P&L responsibility for venture-backed company's top revenue platform in consumer space.

## Not-For-Profit ##

`2016`

- Fulfilment Lead
- Reported to Campaign Manager. Responsible for all door-to-door deliveries of collateral merchandise (T-shirts, buttons, etc.) and lawn signs to campaign donors.

`2001–2004`
__Two Rivers Montessori School__, Portland, OR
- Board of Trustees
- One of 3 Board members who turned around not-for-profit private school from collapse, at 50% under-enrollment after staffing meltdown. We rapidly conceived, and successfully pitched to stakeholders, a compellingly bold and imaginative 5-Year Strategic Plan. We averted the crisis by hiring critical teaching and admin staff; reaffirming the school's positive reputation; retaining existing families while recruiting new students; and raising over $100K in new funds within 24 months. The school reached cash-positive operation within 3 years, with waiting lists for all classes.
